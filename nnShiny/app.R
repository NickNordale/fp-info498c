        the states with the cheapest private health insurance, did not necessarily have the cheapest 
        average ACA insurance. For example, Virginiaâ€™s average private cost is relatively normal compared 
        to its extremely high ACA cost. Similarly, Utah has the highest average private costs, but they 
        have a fairly normal average ACA cost. This may be worth digging into more thoroughly in the future.")
